# Modified UNO Game Project
1. Description of our problem domain: <br>
      Our problem domain is a card game. Our project aims to develop a card game like Uno through Java. The objective of Uno is to be the first player to get rid of all their cards by matching them in color or number to the top card of the discard pile. Uno cards come in four colors (red, blue, green, and yellow) and have numbers and special action cards like "Skip," "Reverse," etc.

2. A brief, high-level description of what kind of application our team is thinking of developing: <br>
      We aim to develop a Java-based card game application that offers both a Human-Computer game mode and a Human-Human game mode. Additionally, we will integrate an UNO API to enhance our game. We will develop UI for our interface adapters. For each player, he/she can choose between either game mode. We will also have a friend system so that user could add and play with friends. We will also create a ranking system for each player using the K/D data as our infrastructure layer.
