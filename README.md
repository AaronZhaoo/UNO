# Modified UNO Game Project
1. Description of our problem domain: <br>
      Our problem domain is a card game. Our project aims to develop a card game like Uno through Java. The objective of Uno is to be the first player to get rid of all their cards by matching them in color or number to the top card of the discard pile. Uno cards come in four colors (red, blue, green, and yellow) and have numbers and special action cards like "Skip," "Reverse," etc.

2. A brief, high-level description of what kind of application our team is thinking of developing: <br>
      We want to create a card game application that is build upon Java. The application allows Human-Computer game mode and Human-Human game mode. We will implement an UNO API assist in our game.
